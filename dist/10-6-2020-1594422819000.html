Blogging is hard. Social media posting is easy. So maybe the blog can be built from the social media?</p>
<p>Think about it, you get so much out of the box using someone else's site as your CMS. Lemmy takes markdown, and turns it into server-generated HTML which it serves up via RSS. It includes comments, and when Lemmy federates, those comments could come from members of any other Lemmy instance, offering users a low-overhead to commenting. Lemmy even includes image hosting!</p>
